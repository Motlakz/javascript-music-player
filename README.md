## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- Pause a song when clicking on the pause icon and play a song when clicking on the play icon.
- Toggle back and forth between 2 different songs using the next and previous buttons.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page and glow animation for the play-pause feature.
- Listen to the two songs interchangeably.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript DOM Manipulation, functions, constructors, event listeners and state management.

### What I learned

- How to use state management outside of frameworks;
- achieving a specific task once the page window has loaded with a "load" event listener;
- to start a song automatically on page load;
- formatting numbers to match minutes to seconds;
- using a "timeupdate" event listener to update duration as the song progresses.

### Continued development

I will always take every opportunity to hone my JavaScript Skills from intermediate to advanced concepts. I hope to grow into frameworks as I build.
